<h1>CS-350 Computer Organizations</h1>

<div id="descriptionBox">
<p>

	The purpose of this course is to provide you with a basic understanding of how computers do what they do. <br/>
In your CS courses up to this point you have been writing programs that control a computer.<br/>
You have used these programs to get the computer to perform particular tasks.<br/> 
But how is the computer able to understand the language of your program?<br/>
What is inside that box we call a computer?<br/><img src="computer-code.jpg"/></br>
These are the fundamental question that we will be answering this semester.<br/>
We will answer these questions by designing and building (simulating) a computer and ultimately writing programs that run on our computer.
